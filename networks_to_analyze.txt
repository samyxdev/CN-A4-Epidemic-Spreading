Performed MC simulations on different SF networks for RP(reactive process).

10 plots: (different random scale-free networks satisfying generated using the CONFIGURATION MODEL)
	--> fix size N of the net to 500 or 1000 nodes and try different values for gamma (we may try e.g. : gamma =  2.7, 3.0, 3.3) 
	-->  generate different BA nets( i.e. fixed gamma) but with different values of N (we may try N = 500 and N = 1000)
	--> try 1 real network (e.g. airports)
	-->
	-->



REMINDER: 
--------AT LEAST 10 PLOTS (i.e. simulations)
--------N should be at least 500
--------SAVE ALL THE GENERATED NETWORKS



I'm already doing:
BA with N = 500; m = 5
BA with N = 1000; m = 5
